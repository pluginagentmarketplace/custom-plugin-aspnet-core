# Code Quality & Leadership Skills

## Code Review Excellence

### Review Checklist
- **Functionality:** Does it work?
- **Security:** Are there vulnerabilities?
- **Performance:** Is it efficient?
- **Readability:** Is it understandable?
- **Testing:** Is it well-tested?
- **Documentation:** Is it documented?
- **Standards:** Does it follow guidelines?

### Best Practices
- Review for intent, not style
- Ask questions rather than demand changes
- Praise good practices
- Suggest rather than dictate
- Provide context and rationale

## QA Engineering Path

### Testing Mindset
- Think like a user
- Find edge cases
- Consider error scenarios
- Test across platforms

### Test Pyramid
```
End-to-End Tests (10%)
    ↑
Integration Tests (30%)
    ↑
Unit Tests (60%)
```

### Test Planning
1. Understand requirements
2. Identify test cases
3. Design test scenarios
4. Execute tests
5. Report defects
6. Verify fixes

## Technical Leadership

### Skills Development
```
Technical Excellence
    +
Communication
    +
Decision Making
    +
Mentoring
    = Technical Leader
```

### Responsibilities
- Code quality standards
- Architecture decisions
- Technology selection
- Team mentoring
- Knowledge sharing

### Leadership Styles
- **Coaching:** Guide and develop
- **Directive:** Clear instructions
- **Supportive:** Listen and help
- **Participative:** Collaborative

## Algorithms & Data Structures

### Array Algorithms
- Binary search: O(log n)
- Two pointers: O(n)
- Sliding window: O(n)

### Graph Algorithms
- DFS/BFS: O(V + E)
- Dijkstra: O(V log V)
- Topological sort: O(V + E)

### Dynamic Programming
- Memoization
- Tabulation
- Optimal substructure
- Overlapping subproblems

### Time Complexity
```
O(1) - Constant
O(log n) - Logarithmic
O(n) - Linear
O(n log n) - Linearithmic
O(n²) - Quadratic
O(2ⁿ) - Exponential
O(n!) - Factorial
```

- Space vs time complexity
- Amortized analysis
- Trade-offs

### Data Structures
- Arrays: O(1) access
- Linked Lists: O(1) insertion
- Hash Tables: O(1) average
- Trees: O(log n) balanced
- Graphs: Various complexities

### Fundamental Concepts
- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms
- Search techniques

- Error handling
- Comments when needed

### Design Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory
- Observer
- Strategy
- Decorator

### SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility
- **O**pen/Closed
- **L**iskov Substitution
- **I**nterface Segregation
- **D**ependency Inversion

## Key Competencies

1. **Code Review** - Quality assessment
2. **Testing Strategy** - QA planning
3. **Communication** - Clear expression
4. **Mentoring** - Team development
5. **Algorithms** - Problem-solving
